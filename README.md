# Controlling DC moter using Python on Raspberry Pi
## Description
This is a repository for controlling DC motors on Raspberry Pi in Python.
## Implementation Details
The implementation involves setting up a Python environment and installing packages by running `setup.sh` on Raspberry PI OS (64bit, GUI) for the first time. The development environment uses Debian (bullseye) on Docker, and a shell script is executed every time the container is started.

- For Raspberry PI OS (64bit, GUI):
    - Run `setup.sh` for the first time to set up the Python environment and install packages.
- For the development environment using Debian (bullseye) on Docker:
    - A shell script is executed every time the container is started.
